# JavaWebDevComplete

This repository is a newer version of one which started years ago. With the advent of Jakarta EE, and now Spring 6 and Spring Boot 3, substantial updates have recently been completed. IntelliJ with Maven support was used for all the code and projects here.

A collection of materials and resources related to Java JSP, Servlet, Servlet MVC, Spring, Spring MVC, Spring AOP, Spring Security, Hibernate and more developed from a series of courses.

There are several complete applications written to synthesize learning throughout the material. Screenshots of each functioning application are included in each application folder. These applications are noted for each section below.

The code and applications in this repository utilized <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> css and JavaScript for styling and functionality.

Topics covered within this repository include but are not limited to:

Credit to instructor <a href="http://www.luv2code.com/" target="_blank">Chad Darby</a> for introducing so many of these topics and covering them so well in his various courses. Much of the material here is an outgrowth of what Chad has shared.

I highly recommend Chad's courses, all of which can be found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/chaddarby2/">here</a>.

While grateful to Chad's courses, all of the code in this repository differs, in part of in some cases in whole, from that provided in the course work. Any errors that exist here are solely mine.

Recently, for example, Section 10 has been expanded substantially for command line testing of database access with Spring JPA Repositories and Service layers.

Update: Getting to some new material the next few weeks related to MVC, Advanced Data Mappings, and AOP.
